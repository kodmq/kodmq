## Overview

**KodMQ** is a simple and easy to use Node.js message queue system that allows you to perform and schedule jobs.

</div>

## Features

- üëç **Simple**: KodMQ is designed to be simple to use and easy to understand
- üîã **Batteries Included**: KodMQ comes with a **built-in UI** to manage your jobs
- üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Flexible**: KodMQ can be used with **Redis** or **Prisma (In Development)**
- <img src={tsLogo.src} alt="TypeScript Logo" className="w-4 h-4 inline-block not-prose -translate-y-px" /> **TypeScript**: KodMQ is written in **TypeScript** and provides type definitions

## Contents

## Installation (Recommended)

Just run this command and follow the instructions:

```bash
pnpm create kodmq@latest
```

## Installation (Manual)

This installation guide assumes that you are using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

**If you are using JavaScript**, you will need to change the file extension from `.ts` to `.js`, remove type annotations and use `node` instead of `ts-node` in the scripts.

Let's get started!

1. Install packages

    ```bash
    pnpm install kodmq kodmq-ui
    ```

2. Create configuration file `./jobs/index.ts`. Ideally, to keep your code organized, you should create a separate file for each handler and put them under `./jobs/handlers` directory.

    ```ts
    import KodMQ, { Handlers } from "kodmq"

    const handlers: Handlers = {
      sendEmail: async ({ to, text }) => {
        // Logic to send email
      },
    }

    const kodmq = new KodMQ({ handlers })

    export default kodmq
    ```

3. Create file `./jobs/launch.ts`. This file will be used to launch your workers.

    ```ts
    import kodmq from "./index"
    import kodmqLauncher from "kodmq/launcher"

    await kodmqLauncher(kodmq)
    ```

4. Add these scripts to your `package.json`

    ```json5
    {
      // ...
      "scripts": {
        "workers": "ts-node ./jobs/launch.ts",
        "workers:ui": "kodmq-ui"
      },
      // ...
    }
    ```

5. Launch your workers and UI üéâ

    ```bash
    pnpm run workers
    pnpm run workers:ui
    ```

## Usage

Okay, now you have your workers running. Let's see how you can run some jobs.

### Perform a job

When you're performing a job, it will be pushed to the queue and performed by the first available worker.

```ts
import kodmq from "./jobs"

const job = await kodmq.performJob("sendEmail", { to: "Andrew Kodkod", text: "Have a good day!" })
console.log(job)
```

### Schedule a job

When you're scheduling a job, it will be saved to the database and performed by the first available worker at the specified time.

```ts
import kodmq from "./jobs"

const runAt = new Date(Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24) // 1 day later
const job = await kodmq.scheduleJob(runAt, "sendEmail", { to: "Andrew Kodkod", text: "I hope you had a good day!" })
console.log(job)
```

## Core Concepts

### Job

A job is a task that needs to be performed. It can be performed immediately or scheduled to be performed later.

Job may have one of the following statuses:
- `Pending` ‚Äì Job is waiting to be performed
- `Scheduled` ‚Äì Job is scheduled to be performed later
- `Active` ‚Äì Job is being performed
- `Completed` ‚Äì Job has been performed successfully
- `Failed` ‚Äì Job has failed to be performed

### Worker

A worker is a process that performs jobs.

Workers can be launched using `kodmq/launcher` package or just by calling `await kodmq.start()`.

Worker may have one of the following statuses:
- `Idle` ‚Äì Worker is waiting for jobs
- `Active` ‚Äì Worker is performing a job
- `Stopping` ‚Äì Worker is in the process of stopping (waiting for the current job to be completed)
- `Stopped` ‚Äì Worker is stopped

### Concurrency

Concept of concurrency in KodMQ is a bit different from other libraries.
As we're trying to keep things simple, we don't have concept of worker threads.
What does it mean? It means **1 thread = 1 worker**.

Let me explain it with an example.

When you're launching your application with concurrency of 5:
```ts
kodmqLauncher(kodmq, { concurrency: 5 })
// or
pnpm run workers --concurrency 5
```

It runs a single process that can handle 5 jobs simultaneously, and you'll see 5 workers in the UI.

If you want to run multiple processes, you can just run the launcher multiple times:
```ts
pnpm run workers --concurrency 2
pnpm run workers --concurrency 3
```

To make sure things don't get messy in KodMQ UI, or you want to benchmark performance of different servers, you can specify a name for each "cluster":
```ts
// Command to run locally
pnpm run workers --concurrency 5 --name "Local"

// Command to run on server 1
pnpm run workers --concurrency 5 --name "AWS 4vCPU"

// Command to run on server 2
pnpm run workers --concurrency 5 --name "DigitalOcean 4vCPU"
```

All this data, will be saved to the database and shown in the KodMQ UI.

**By default**, KodMQ uses `os.cpus().length - 1` as concurrency, so you don't need to specify it manually.

## Environment Variables

You can use environment variables to configure KodMQ

```bash
KODMQ_REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
KODMQ_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/kodmq
KODMQ_CONCURRENCY=5
```

## Jobs API

```ts
import kodmq, { Pending, Completed } from "./jobs"

// Get all jobs
const jobs = await kodmq.getJobs()

// Get jobs by status
const pendingJobs = await kodmq.getJobs({ status: Pending })
const completedJobs = await kodmq.getJobs({ status: Completed })

// Get specific job
const job = await kodmq.getJob(1)
```

## Workers API

```ts
import kodmq, { Idle, Active } from "./jobs"

// Get all workers
const workers = await kodmq.getWorkers()

// Get workers by status
const idleWorkers = await kodmq.getWorkers({ status: Idle })
const activeWorkers = await kodmq.getWorkers({ status: Active })

// Get specific worker
const worker = await kodmq.getWorker(1)

// Stop specific worker
await kodmq.stopWorker(worker)
```

## That's it!

I hope you'll find **KodMQ** useful and enjoy using it!
