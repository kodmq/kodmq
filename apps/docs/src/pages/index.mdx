</div>

## Features

- üëç **Simple**: KodMQ is designed to be simple to use and easy to understand

- <img src={tsLogo.src} alt="TypeScript Logo" className="w-4 h-4 inline-block not-prose -translate-y-px" /> **TypeScript**: KodMQ is written in **TypeScript** and provides type definitions

## Contents

## Installation (Recommended)

Just run this command and follow the instructions:

```bash
bun create kodmq@latest
```

## Installation (Manual)

This installation guide assumes that you are using [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

**If you aren't using Bun**, you need to replace `bun run` with `node` or `ts-node` in the `package.json`.

**If you are using JavaScript**, you need to change the file extension from `.ts` to `.js` and remove type annotations.

Let's get started!

1. Install packages

    ```bash
    bun install @kodmq/core @kodmq/adapter-redis @kodmq/ui
    ```

2. Create configuration file `./jobs/index.ts`. Ideally, to keep your code organized, you should create a separate file for each handler and put them under `./jobs/handlers` directory.

    ```ts
    import KodMQ from "@kodmq/core"
    import { Handlers } from "@kodmq/core/types"

    const handlers: Handlers = {
      sendEmail: async ({ to, text }) => {
        // Logic to send email
      },
    }

    const kodmq = new KodMQ({ handlers })

    export default kodmq
    ```

3. Create file `./jobs/launch.ts`. This file will be used to launch your workers.

    ```ts
    import kodmq from "./index"
    import kodmqLauncher from "@kodmq/core/launcher"

    await kodmqLauncher(kodmq)
    ```

4. Add these scripts to your `package.json`

    ```json5
    {
      // ...
      "scripts": {
        "workers": "bun run ./jobs/launch.ts",
        "workers:ui": "kodmq-ui"
      },
      // ...
    }
    ```

5. That's it! Now you can launch your workers and KodMQ UI üéâ

    ```bash
    bun run workers
    bun run workers:ui
    ```

## Usage

Okay, now you have your workers running. Let's see how you can perform some jobs.

### Perform Job

When you're performing a job, it will be pushed to the queue and performed by the first available worker.

```ts
import kodmq from "./jobs"

const job = await kodmq.jobs.perform("sendEmail", { to: "Andrew Kodkod", text: "Have a good day!" })
console.log(job)
```

### Schedule Job

When you're scheduling a job, it will be saved to the database and performed by the first available worker at the specified time.

```ts
import kodmq from "./jobs"

const runAt = new Date(Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24) // 1 day later
const job = await kodmq.jobs.performAt(runAt, "sendEmail", { to: "Andrew Kodkod", text: "I hope you had a good day!" })
console.log(job)

// or

const runIn = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 // 1 day later
const job = await kodmq.jobs.performIn(runIn, "sendEmail", { to: "Andrew Kodkod", text: "I hope you had a good day!" })
console.log(job)
```

## Core Concepts

### Job

A job is a task that needs to be performed. It can be performed immediately or scheduled to be performed later.

Job may have one of the following statuses:
- `Pending` ‚Äì Job is waiting to be performed
- `Scheduled` ‚Äì Job is scheduled to be performed later
- `Active` ‚Äì Job is being performed
- `Completed` ‚Äì Job has been performed successfully
- `Failed` ‚Äì Job has failed to be performed

### Worker

A worker is a single thread that performs jobs.

Worker may have one of the following statuses:
- `Idle` ‚Äì Worker is waiting for jobs
- `Busy` ‚Äì Worker is performing a job
- `Stopping` ‚Äì Worker is in the process of stopping (waiting for the current job to be completed)
- `Stopped` ‚Äì Worker is stopped
- `Killed` ‚Äì Worker was killed while performing a job (job was not completed and will be retried)

### Concurrency

Concept of concurrency in KodMQ is a bit different from other libraries.
As we're trying to keep things simple, we don't have concept of worker threads.
What does it mean? It means **1 thread = 1 worker**.

Let me explain it with an example.

When you're launching your application with concurrency of 5:
```ts
kodmqLauncher(kodmq, { concurrency: 5 })
// or
bun run workers --concurrency=5
```

It runs a single process that can handle 5 jobs simultaneously, but you'll see 5 workers in the UI.

If you want to run multiple processes, you can just run the launcher multiple times:
```ts
bun run workers --concurrency=2
bun run workers --concurrency=3
```

To make sure things don't get messy in KodMQ UI, or you want to benchmark performance of different servers, you can specify a name for each "cluster":
```ts
// Command to run locally
bun run workers --concurrency=5 --cluster-name="Local"

// Command to run on server 1
bun run workers --concurrency=5 --cluster-name="AWS 4vCPU"

// Command to run on server 2
bun run workers --concurrency=5 --cluster-name="DigitalOcean 8vCPU"
```

**By default**, KodMQ uses number of CPU cores as concurrency, so you don't need to specify it manually.

## Environment Variables

You can use environment variables to configure KodMQ

```bash
KODMQ_REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
KODMQ_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/kodmq
KODMQ_CONCURRENCY=5
```

## Jobs API

```ts
import { Pending, Completed } from "@kodmq/core/constants"
import kodmq from "./jobs"

// Get all jobs
const jobs = await kodmq.jobs.all()

// Get jobs by status
const pendingJobs = await kodmq.jobs.all({ status: Pending })
const completedJobs = await kodmq.jobs.all({ status: Completed })

// Get specific job
const job = await kodmq.jobs.find(1)

// Boost job
await kodmq.jobs.boost(job.id)

// Retry job (if it failed)
await kodmq.jobs.retry(job.id)

// Cancel job (keeps it in the database)
await kodmq.jobs.cancel(job.id)

// Remove job from database
await kodmq.jobs.remove(job.id)

// Remove all jobs from database (including pending and scheduled, but not active)
await kodmq.jobs.removeAll()

// Remove all finished jobs from database (completed, failed, canceled)
await kodmq.jobs.removeFinished()

// Wait until all jobs are finished (completed, failed, canceled)
await kodmq.jobs.waitUntilAllFinished()
```

## Workers API

```ts
import KodMQ from "kodmq"
import { Idle, Busy, Stopped } from "@kodmq/core/constants"
import kodmq from "./jobs"

// Get all workers
const workers = await kodmq.workers.all()

// Get workers by status
const idleWorkers = await kodmq.workers.all({ status: Idle })
const busyWorkers = await kodmq.workers.all({ status: Busy })

// Get specific worker
const worker = await kodmq.workers.find(1)

// Stop specific worker
await kodmq.workers.stop(worker.id)

// Stop all workers (launched in current process)
await kodmq.workers.stopAll()

// Wait until all workers are stopped (launched in current process)
await kodmq.workers.waitUntilAllInStatus(Stopped)
```
